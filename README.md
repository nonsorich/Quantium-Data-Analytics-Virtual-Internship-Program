<h2>About Quantium</h2>
Quantium is an IT company that delivers solutions in data and technology for individuals, society,<br /> and organizations..

<h3>Problematic</h3>
You are part of Quantium's retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category<br /> Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours<br /> to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

Examine transaction data - look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers,<br /> correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If you determine any anomalies make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to your analysis.
Examine customer data - check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you<br /> are happy merge the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the analysis ensuring you save your files along the way.
Data analysis and customer segments - in your analysis make sure you define the metrics – look at<br /> total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find.
Deep dive into customer segments – define your recommendation from your insights, determine which<br /> segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis.
